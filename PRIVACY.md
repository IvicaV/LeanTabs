# Privacy Policy for LeanTabs

**Last Updated:** December 7, 2025

## 1. Introduction
LeanTabs ("the Extension") is developed by an individual developer. I am dedicated to protecting your privacy. The core principle of this project is simple: **Your data belongs to you.**

## 2. Data Collection and Storage
**I do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on any external servers.**

*   **Local Storage:** All data generated by the Extension, including saved sessions, links, window structures, and workspace configurations, is stored locally on your device using the browser's native storage API (`chrome.storage.local`).
*   **Offline Functionality:** The Extension functions entirely offline. No data is ever sent to me or any third-party analytics services.

## 3. Permissions and Usage
To function correctly, LeanTabs requires specific permissions. Here is exactly how I use them:

*   **Read and modify all your data on the websites you visit (`<all_urls>`):**
    This permission is strictly limited to two local actions performed by the extension:
    1.  Fetching the `<title>` of a webpage when you manually add a raw URL, ensuring the saved link has a readable name.
    2.  Displaying the correct **Favicon** (website icon) for your saved links in the dashboard.
    *I do not track, log, or transmit your browsing history.*

*   **Tabs & Storage:** Used solely to identify open tabs, convert them into saved sessions locally, and restore them when requested by you.

## 4. Third-Party Data Sharing
Since I do not collect any data from your device, I do not (and cannot) sell, trade, or transfer your information to third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the Extension does not have a backend server to notify you, I recommend checking this page periodically for any changes.

## 6. Contact
