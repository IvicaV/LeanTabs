> **"Don't just suspend your clutter. Solve it."**

**LeanTabs** transforms your browser from a resource-hogging mess into a streamlined productivity machine.

### ⛔ The Problem with other tools
*   **Tab Suspenders:** They keep tabs open but "frozen". This saves memory but still leaves your tab bar cluttered, causing mental fatigue ("Where was that tab again?").
*   **Simple Cleaners:** They ruthlessly close everything. You lose context, window positions, and active workflows.

### ✅ The LeanTabs Solution
LeanTabs is based on a simple philosophy: **Tabs eat RAM. Links don't.**

It acts as a **Smart Converter**. Instead of keeping resource-heavy tabs open, it instantly converts them into organized, lightweight **Lists of Links**. It secures your data first, then selectively clears memory, giving you the performance of a fresh browser with the safety of a full backup.

✨ **Advanced Workspace Support:** LeanTabs is designed for multitaskers. It features native detection for multiple windows and deep integration for things like **Opera Workspaces**, ensuring that your separate project areas remain isolated, are correctly named, and can be easily restored.

---

### ⚡ How it works in 3 seconds:
1.  **Select Scope** 🎯 → Choose your cleanup level: Clean just the **Current Window** to tidy up, or perform a **Global Clean** across all screens to reset your workday.
2.  **Click "Clean"** 🧹 → **Instant Zen.** Background clutter vanishes. RAM is freed instantly. Your browser speeds up immediately.
3.  **Tabs become Links** 💾 → **Zero RAM.** LeanTabs converts every single tab (even the ones kept open) into a secure link within a named session.
4.  **Restore Precision** ↩️ → **Resume Flow.** Turn any link back into a live tab. Restore a specific window or an entire workspace setup with one click.

## 🚀 Power Features: Why LeanTabs?

### 🧠 Context-Aware Intelligence
LeanTabs distinguishes between your **Active Focus** and **Background Noise**.
*   **Active Window Logic:** In your current window, it keeps your most recent tabs open (customizable, e.g., last 3) so your immediate flow isn't interrupted.
*   **Deep Hibernation:** In "Global Mode", background windows and workspaces are saved as separate Link Sessions and then **closed completely** to maximize system performance.

### 🛡️ Frictionless Protection
Found a site you never want to close (Spotify, CRM, WhatsApp)?
*   **Instant Shield:** Simply click the **Shield Icon 🛡️** next to any link in the dashboard.
*   **Domain Lock:** This domain is now whitelisted. LeanTabs will clean around it, keeping your essential tools running while converting the rest into links.

### 🗂️ Your Productivity Database
The "Saved Links" dashboard turns your browsing history into an organized asset.
*   **Granular Restoration:** Even after a global clean, every window and workspace is saved as a separate tile. You have the freedom to restore specific projects individually, exactly when you need them.
*   **Live Search:** Stop digging through history. Find any link by title, URL, or category instantly.
*   **Smart Organization:** Manage hundreds of sessions easily with collapsible lists and the global "Collapse/Expand" controls.

### ➕ Research Assistant
You can also add links manually to your sessions! Paste a URL, and LeanTabs **automatically fetches the page title** for you (e.g., converting a YouTube link into the video title).

### 🏷️ Smart Auto-Categorization
Chaos is the enemy. LeanTabs **automatically detects the source** of every link (e.g., "YouTube", "GitHub", "Amazon") and applies a clean category tag. Want custom organization? You can rename any category tag manually to fit your project needs (e.g., change "Google Docs" to "Thesis Sources").

### 🔒 The "Triple Safety" Net
I engineered LeanTabs to make data loss impossible.
1.  **Session Archives:** Every clean action creates a visible, editable list of links in your dashboard.
2.  **Unified Auto-Backup:** A fail-safe background mechanism that creates a full backup file of *everything* you cleaned. Even if you delete a session by mistake, the global backup has you covered.
3.  **Privacy First:** Your data belongs to you. LeanTabs stores all your sessions and links **locally on your device** (`chrome.storage`). I do not track you, have no analytics, and do not upload your data to any cloud servers.

> *Note: The extension only connects to the internet when you manually add a link (to fetch the title) or to load website icons (favicons).*

## 💡 7 Real-World Scenarios: Do you recognize yourself?

### 1. The "Panic" Screen Share (Privacy & Professionalism) 🎥
You are in a meeting and need to share your screen immediately. But you have 40 tabs open—some work, some private (Amazon, Reddit), and it looks chaotic.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Select **Global Scope** and click **Clean**.
*   **The Result:** In 1 second, your browser looks professional and clean. Only your 3 active work tabs remain. Your private tabs aren't lost—they are safely converted to links in the dashboard, ready to be reopened later.

### 2. The "Deep Work" Tunnel (Focus) 🧠
You need to write a report or code a feature. You open a new window, but your other 3 windows (Email, Slack, News) are blinking and distracting you in the background.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Hit **Global Clean**.
*   **The Result:** *Ruthless Focus.* LeanTabs aggressively closes all background windows (removing the visual noise) but saves them as separate sessions. You can focus 100% on your task. When you're done, just restore the "Email Window" tile.

### 3. The "Project Juggler" (Agency/Freelancer) 🤹
You are switching between "Client A" (Workspace 1) and "Client B" (Workspace 2) multiple times a day. Keeping everything open eats 8GB of RAM.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Before switching, run a clean.
*   **The Result:** You essentially "freeze" Client A's entire workspace state into a session file. You open Client B on a fresh canvas. No lag, no confusion. Swapping clients creates zero friction—you pick up exactly where you left off.

### 4. The "Background Music" Survivor (The Shield Feature) 🛡️
You want to clean up your mess, but you are listening to a podcast on YouTube or waiting for an important email in Outlook. You are afraid a "Cleaner" will kill the audio.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Go to Saved Links once. Click the **Shield Icon 🛡️** next to YouTube and Outlook. Now hit **Global Clean**.
*   **The Result:** 50 tabs vanish, RAM is freed, but your music keeps playing and your inbox stays open. The perfect balance between order and utility.

### 5. The "Friday Afternoon" Reset (Mental Health) 🧘
It's Friday, 5 PM. You have 3 windows open with unfinished tasks. You want to shut down, but you're anxious you'll forget where you left off on Monday.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Run a clean. Go to the dashboard and rename the newest session to *"To Do Monday"*.
*   **The Result:** You leave work with "Inbox Zero" for your browser. On Monday, you don't face a chaotic mess; you see one clear button labeled "To Do Monday" that restores your entire environment instantly.

### 6. The "Thesis Defender" (Knowledge Management) 🎓
You are researching a complex topic. You have 30 tabs open (PDFs, Sources). You find a goldmine of info, but you need to restart your PC or switch tasks.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Don't bookmark (bookmarks are where links go to die). Let LeanTabs save it.
*   **The Result:** Your research is now a searchable database of links. You can search for keywords in the page titles later ("What was that PDF about Quantum Physics?"). Restoring the session brings back the *exact* window arrangement, so you don't lose your mental map.

### 7. The "FPS Hunter" (Gaming & Rendering) ⚡
You want to launch a heavy game (Cyberpunk) or render a 4K video. Chrome is running in the background, consuming resources even when minimized.
*   **The LeanTabs Move:** Don't just minimize Chrome. **Global Clean** it.
*   **The Result:** LeanTabs keeps your browser open (so you don't lose your login sessions/cookies) but strips it down to the bare minimum (e.g., 1 blank tab). Your CPU and RAM are fully released for your game. When you're done gaming, one click restores your browsing life.

## 👥 Who is LeanTabs for?

*   **Students & Knowledge Workers:** Automatically archive your research sessions and access them later for citations.
