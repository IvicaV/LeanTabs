# 🧹 LeanTabs – Smart Tab & Workspace Manager

**Hundreds of open tabs? A sluggish browser? Drowning in tab clutter?**

LeanTabs is the smart solution that transforms your browser back into a productivity powerhouse.

It is more than just a tab closer — it's your personal tab management assistant. Unlike simple "tab suspenders," LeanTabs intelligently closes old tabs but saves them instantly into a beautiful, searchable dashboard. Designed for power users who demand efficiency without ever losing an important link.

## 🚀 Why LeanTabs is the right choice for you

### 🎯 Focus on One Project at a Time
Clean up just your **current window or workspace** while leaving your other projects untouched. Need a full reset? You can also clean up all windows globally. You are in control!

### 🧹 One-Click "Tab Clean"
One click in the popup is all it takes. LeanTabs closes all unnecessary tabs instantly. The last few active tabs (customizable, e.g., 3) stay open so you can keep working without interruption.

### 🔒 Nothing is Ever Lost
Every closed tab is automatically saved into a dated and named **"Session"**. You can access your old research and link collections at any time via the dashboard.

### 🗂️ Powerful Session Manager
Open the "Saved Links" page to manage your sessions. Rename them, restore entire sessions with a single click, open individual links, or delete what you no longer need.

### ➕ Research Assistant
Add links manually to your sessions! Paste a URL, and LeanTabs **automatically fetches the page title** for you (e.g., converting a YouTube link into the video title).

### 🪟 Smart Restore
Restores your tabs exactly how you left them – respecting your **original window structure**. If a session had tabs from two different windows, LeanTabs can reopen them in two new windows.

### 🛡️ Multiple Safety Nets
*   **Automatic Backups:** Your data is safe, even if you close the browser.
*   **Whitelist:** Protect important sites (Email, Music, Calendar) so they are never closed automatically.
*   **Export/Import:** Move your data to another device easily.

### 🛡️ Privacy First
LeanTabs runs **100% offline**. Your data is stored locally on your device via `chrome.storage`. No tracking, no analytics, no cloud servers.

## 👥 Who is LeanTabs for?

*   **Developers, Designers & Researchers:** Stay focused by keeping only the relevant window or **Opera Workspace** active.
*   **Students & Knowledge Workers:** Automatically archive your research sessions and access them later for citations.
*   **Anyone suffering from "tab-itis":** Free your browser (and your mind) from digital clutter.
